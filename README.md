# findmyhatv2

I uploaded a v2 to revamp the code.

# What did you like about this project? 
It's really challenging and we need to utilise a lot of different concepts we have learnt in the lessons.

# What did you struggle with in this project? 
I struggled quite a bit with the application of the concepts taught. How do we integrate the different js concepts into the game. In the end, I could not complete the game as it was really challenging to set up the field, move the direction of the character, and set the conditions to win or lose.

# What would make your experience with this assessment better? 
I'm not really sure how everyone else did, but I hope the assessment can be simplified with more hints given to suit our level :)
